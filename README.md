# Flutter Bytes: Hub

With the holes in the Flutter SDK implementation and the amount of 3rd party libraries used just to get an awesome branded Flutter app it becomes vital to cover those 3rd party libraries.

Also, the Flutter SDK team, Google, and Google Developer Experts only cover an extremely small part of the 3rd party libraries one needs to use to develop Flutter Apps. So this my way to distinguish my articles and Flutter App Book series from other offerings.
